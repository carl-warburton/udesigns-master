# Design and Documentation

# Problem definition

Many Talented designers are graduating University and Tafe with little job
opportunities, leaving many of them unable to utilise their skills due to
financial constraints.

# Solution

This platform allows designers to sell their designs
without needing the capital to start their own business.

TO DO

The next step of the UDesigns app would be to allow Designers to easily share
their designs straight from the platform to their own social media accounts.
Allowing designers to drive their own sales.
